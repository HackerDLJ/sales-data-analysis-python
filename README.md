# sales-data-analysis-python
Week-2 Internship Project
## Project Description

This project involved a comprehensive sales data analysis to understand various aspects of sales performance. The key objectives included:

*   **Data Preparation**: Generating a synthetic `order_date` column to enable time-series analysis, as the original dataset lacked this crucial information.
*   **Product-wise Analysis**: Calculating total sales per product, identifying top-performing and lowest-performing items, and visualizing these trends with bar charts.
*   **Category-wise Analysis**: Aggregating sales by product categories, identifying the most and least successful categories, and visualizing their contribution to overall sales.
*   **Monthly Sales Analysis**: Extracting monthly sales trends from the `order_date` and visualizing month-over-month performance.
*   **Summarization and Insights**: Integrating findings from all analyses to provide a holistic view of sales performance, highlighting key insights, trends, and actionable recommendations for business strategy.
*   **Data Export**: Exporting the final processed dataset to a CSV file.

## Tools Used

The following Python libraries were primarily used in this analysis:

*   **`pandas`**: For data manipulation, cleaning, aggregation, and handling DataFrames.
*   **`matplotlib.pyplot`**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
*   **`seaborn`**: For creating aesthetically pleasing and informative statistical graphics, built on `matplotlib`.
*   **`numpy`**: (Implicitly used by pandas) For numerical operations and array processing.
